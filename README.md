```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following environment variables:

```env
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=<your_postgres_connection_string>
JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
```

4. Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Update the API base URL in `src/api/axios.js` if needed:

```javascript
const API = axios.create({
  baseURL: "http://localhost:5000/api"
});
```

4. Start the frontend:

```bash
npm start
```

The app will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## ðŸš€ Deployment

This project is fully deployed with the following stack:

* **Frontend**: Vercel
* **Backend**: Render
* **Database**: Railway (PostgreSQL)

---

### 1. Backend Deployment (Render)

1. Push your backend code to a public GitHub repository.
2. Go to [Render](https://render.com/) and create a new **Web Service**.
3. Connect your GitHub repository and select the backend folder.
4. Set the **Build Command** and **Start Command** as:

   ```bash
   Build Command: npm install
   Start Command: npm start
   ```
5. Add the following **Environment Variables** in Render:

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=<Your Railway PostgreSQL Connection URL>
   JWT_SECRET=<Your Secret Key>
   FRONTEND_URL=<Your Vercel Domain>
   PORT=10000
   ```
6. Deploy and note down your backend URL, for example:

   ```
   https://task-manager-application-w05c.onrender.com
   ```

---

### 2. Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

1. Push your frontend code to a GitHub repository.
2. Visit [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and import the frontend repo.
3. Set up the following **Environment Variables** in Vercel (if required):

   ```bash
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://task-manager-application-w05c.onrender.com/api
   ```
4. Deploy and verify your frontend URL, for example:

   ```
   https://full-stack-todo-list-application.vercel.app
   ```

---

### 3. Database Deployment (Railway)

1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app/) and create a new **PostgreSQL** project.
2. Copy the **Connection URL** and paste it into your backend `.env` or Render environment variables.
3. Connect using `psql` or a GUI client (e.g., TablePlus, pgAdmin) to manage and inspect data.

---

### 4. Connecting Everything

* Ensure your backend `CORS` configuration includes:

  ```js
  const allowedOrigin = process.env.FRONTEND_URL || "*";
  app.use(cors({ origin: allowedOrigin, credentials: true }));
  ```
* Ensure the frontend `axios.js` base URL points to the deployed backend:

  ```js
  const API = axios.create({
    baseURL: "https://task-manager-application-w05c.onrender.com/api", //you backend url
  });
  ```

---

### 5. Verification Steps

After both deployments:

1. Open your frontend URL on Vercel.
2. Test user registration and login.
3. Verify tasks CRUD operations (add, update, delete, filter).
4. Confirm data persistence in the Railway database.
